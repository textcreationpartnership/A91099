         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>GIve eare O ye heavens and I will ſpeak: and hear O earth the words of my mouth: I will declare unto you the wonders of God: I will publiſh the name of the Lord, and the mighty operation of his power: he is the Rock and the ſure Foundation: his work is perfect: all his ways are judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and righteouſneſs; he is a God of Truth, and without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquity; juſt and righteous is he, and all his wayes are juſt and equal: he is of purer eyes then to behold iniquity; his way is pure, and his Worſhip is likewiſe pure and ſpiritual, and he ſits in his Throne of Righteouſneſs, Juſtice, and Judgment, and the wicked cannot ſtand before him; they are and ſhall be like the chaffe which the winde driveth away, and cannot ſtand in the Judgement, nor the Sinners in the Congregation of the Righteous: Holy and Righteous is the Lord God of Hoſts, and delights in purity; Holineſſe becomes his houſe for
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:116523:3"/>ever: The Temple of God is holy, where he dwells and inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, and where he is worſhipped; and he dwells not in Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples made with hands, as it is written in the Prophets, <hi>The hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is my Throne, and the earth is my Footſtool; where is the houſe that ye build unto me? and where is the place of my reſt? for all thoſe things hath mine hand made, and all thoſe things have been ſaith the Lord: But to this man will I look, even to him that is of a meek and a contrite Spirit, and trembleth at my word.</hi> This is God, the living God, which the Prophets and Apoſtles, and all the Holy Men did bear witneſs unto, and declared of, even what they had ſeen and heard, and taſted of the Word of Life, which was in the beginning with God, and the Word was God, and ſhall endure for ever: The ſame God who at ſundry times and in divers manners, ſpake in times paſt unto the Fathers by the Prophets, hath in theſe laſt dayes ſpoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath given for a Covenant of Light, to lead his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple out of death and darkneſs into righteouſneſs and peace, to have fellowſhip with the Son, and to be Heirs, Joint-Heirs with the Son, whom he hath appointed Heir of all things, by whom alſo he made the world, &amp; all that is therein, the Sun, the Moon the Stars and the Fowls of the air, the Earth and all the Beaſts of the Field, and the creeping things upon the Earth, the Sea and all that is therein; who being the brightneſs of his Glory, and the expreſſe Image of his ſubſtance, upholding all things by the Word of his Power; which power is now manifeſted, which makes the earth to ſhake, and the Inhabitants thereof to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at the wonderful work of our God which is began in this Nation of England. The dreadful God of Hoſt is riſen in his majeſty &amp; great power, &amp; is bringing to paſſe his ſtrange work, which makes the heathen rage, &amp; bite and gnaw their tongues, and ſtand aſtoniſhed at the ſtrange work of the Lord: Behold ye deſpiſers, and wonder and periſh; for I work a work in your daies, which you ſhall in no wiſe believe though a man declare it unto you; and this is fulfilled upon this Generation, who will not believe the work of the Lord though it be declared unto them; but do ſet themſelves in oppoſition againſt the work of God both Rulers and Magiſtrates, Prieſts and People, all join themſelves together in battel againſt the Lamb, but they ſhall not prevail, all is vain, the Lamb ſhall get the Victory, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:116523:3"/>hath gotten the victory; our eyes have ſeen and beheld it; praiſes to his Name for evermore, who hath fulfilled, and is dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fulfilling his promiſe more and more; gathering his ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſheep together, where they have been ſcattered abroad in this cloudy dark day, many yeers the Lords people have been made a prey upon, but the true ſhepherd Chriſt Jeſus is riſen, &amp; is bringing deliverance to his people; gathering them from the mouths of the falſe Shepherds, and bringing them into the fold of reſt and peace, where they ſhall eat and be ſatisfied with li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Refreſhments in the boſome of the Fathers love, and there ſhall be one ſheepfold and one Shepherd: Praiſes to the Lord the day is come, the happy day, the day of glad tydings which we long looked and waited for; the day of our God which is a day of glad tydings to weary and impriſoned Souls, and a day of vengeance and recompence of the Adverſaries of God, as it is declared in the Prophets, <hi>The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me, becauſe the Lord hath annoynted me to preach good tydings unto the meek, he hath ſent me to bind up the broken hearted; to proclaim liberty to the CAPTIVES, and the opening of the PRISON to them that are bound; to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim the acceptable YEER of the LORD, and the DAY of VENGEANCE of our God; to comfort all that mourn, to appoint unto them that mourn in ZION, to give unto them Beauty for Aſhes; the oyl of joy for mourning; the Garment of Praiſe for the Spirit of Heavineſſe; that they might bee called Trees of Righteouſneſs, the Planting of the LORD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this is the Lord fulfilling in our days, he is planting a garden of pleaſant Plants, and watering and dreſſing them, that they may be fruitful, and is plucking up all the wild and fruitleſſe plants, and caſting them into the fire of his wrath there to be burned, that ſo his people may bee a holy and a peculiar people, that he may bee glorified; for hee is come (who is pure) to look for FRUITS, and all fruitleſſe TREES muſt bee cut downe, and caſt into the fire; For the LORD hath looked downe from Heaven, and behold the Land is corrupted; The Garden of the Lord is overſpread with weeds; briars &amp; thorns doth the earth
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:116523:4"/>bring forth: and the faithfull City is become an harlot, as faith the Prophet, It was full of judgment: righteouſneſs lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it, but now murderers: thy ſilver is become droſs, thy wine mixt with water: thy Princes are rebellious, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions of thieves, every one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards.</p>
               <p>See if it be not ſo now: They judge not the fatherleſs, neither doth the Cauſe of the Widdow come before them: therefore ſaith the Lord the God of hoſts, the mighty One of Iſrael, Ah! I will eaſe me of mine adverſaries, and avenge me of mine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>himies, and I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy droſs, and take away all thy tinne, and I will reſtore thy Judges as at the firſt, and thy Counſellors as at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning: afterwards thou ſhalt be called The City of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, the faithfull City, Sion ſhall be redeemed with judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and her Converts with righteouſneſs: And now is this day come that the righteous God is pleading his Cauſe with his Enemies, and purging them with the ſpirit of judgment and of burning.</p>
               <p>And Judgment is begun, according as the Apoſtle foretold: for the time is that Judgment muſt begin at the houſe of God: and if it firſt begin at us, what ſhall be the end of them that obey not the Goſpel of God? Woe and miſery will be their portion, and the deſtruction of the Tranſgreſſors and of the Sinners ſhall be together: and they that forſake the Lord, ſhall be conſumed: for he will be glorified in this his day of Righteouſneſſe and juſt Judgement, which is now ſet up in the earth, which makes the Inhabitants thereof to learn righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, according to the ſaying of the Prophet Iſaiah, The way of the juſt is uprightneſſe, thou moſt upright doſt weigh the path of the juſt; yea in the way of thy judgements, O Lord, have we waited for thee: the deſire of our ſoul is to to thy Name, and to the remembrance of thee: <hi>With my Soul have I I deſired thee; in he might; yea, with my ſpirit within me will I ſeek thee early; for when thy judgements are in the earth, the Inhabitants of the world will learn righteouſneſs: Let favour be ſhewed to the wicked, yet will he not learn righteouſneſs, in the Land of Uprightneſs will he deal unjuſtly, and will not behold
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:116523:4"/>the Majeſty of the Lord, though he ſtretcheth forth his Hand and calls to come forth of the Land of Darkneſs, and waiteth to be gracious; yet all this will not move him, nor break his heart, but goes on careleſly to deſtruction; and becauſe ſentence againſt an evill work is not executed ſpeedily, therefore the heart of the Sons of Men is fully ſet in them to do evill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now the day of juſt Judgement is come, and woe unto the wicked, it ſhall go ill with them, they ſhall not prolong their <hi>Days,</hi> becauſe they fear not before the Lord, the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous God of Heaven and Earth who loves Righteouſneſſe, and no unrighteous one can have union and fellowſhip with him.</p>
               <p>And this is he, the living, pure, holy, righteous God, which the holy men of God did bear Teſtimony of, and the ſame pure holy God do I bear Teſtimony of, which is Light, and in him is no darkneſſe at all; who created man, and made him in his own Image, and gave him Dominion over all other creatures: But all have gone aſtray, and turned aſide from the holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God, and ſo have falne from the pure living God, and loſt his Image, and are become aliens and ſtrangers to Him, their Maker; the God of the world having blinded their minds, and ſtolne away their hearts from the love of the Creator, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Creature, and ſo their love is in the Creature, and worſhips and ſerves that more then the Creator, and their Bodies, which was the Temples of God, and in which was his image and likeneſs, the ſame is become a habitation for the Devil and all unclean luſts; and ſo the image and likeneſs of the Devil, who hath gotten poſſeſſion, and ſits as ruler and king in the heart, and leads the Creature captive at his will, to do his work which is unrighteouſneſs: And here is the firſt mans ſtate, which is from below of the Earth earthly, and mindes Earthly things, careing for the things of this life, what to eat, what to drink, and what to put on, labouring and ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by all ways and means to get great poſſeſſions, and to become great in the Earth, and to have the honour of the World which is below and lies in wickedneſs: and in this ſtate men and women are ſtriving to come again unto the Tree of life, and by their Earthly wiſdom which is ſenſual and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veliſh, goes about to comprehend the things of God, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="1" facs="tcp:116523:5"/>can: it is a myſterie hid and ſealed from this wiſdom, and never can be known there: for the World by wiſdom knows not God.</p>

               <p>Now my dear friends be valiant for your Freedom, and ſtand in that Liberty wherein Chriſt hath ſet you free, and be not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain entangled with the yoke of bondage, and the weak and beggarly Elements of the world; give not away your ſtrength unto the Harlot; though Sinners entice you conſent not to them; but ſtand in the counſel of God, and keep your habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, dwelling in that which is pure which ye have received from God, waiting in patience for power from the Lord to give you a full deliverance over the world and the pollutions and luſts of it, that over it you may raign and all its fading Treaſures, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to your ſelves Treaſures which never ſades away, dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble riches, where the Ruſt and Moth cannot come.</p>
               <p>Dwell low in the pure fear of the Lord, for there is ſafety, that keeps the heart clean; and ſo the pure wiſdom from above is received into the pure heart; and bring all your deeds to the Light, that ſo they may be proved and tried, whether or no they be wrought in God.</p>
               <p>Weigh your words and your Actions in the ballance of equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and be upright and juſt in all your dealings amongſt men in
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:116523:15"/>your buyings and ſellings, and whatſoever things you take in hand; let the Light of Jeſus be your guide, that ſo your conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences may be exerciſed towards God and man, that you may be kept blameleſſe and harmleſſe, as children of God amongſt this wicked and untoward Generation of men, who daily watch with an evil eye for your halting, thereby to take occaſion to blaſpheme God and his pure Truth, which ye in a meaſure are growing up in; and in a good meaſure redeemed from the vile and filthie converſation of the world.</p>
               <p>Dear Friends, keep nothing back, but freely give up into the Will of God that which is for the Sword to the Sword, and that which is for the Famine to the Famine; and what is for the Fire to the Fire, that you may be thorowly cleanſed and purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and tried as Gold and Silver is tried. Whatſoever the Light of Chriſt doth diſcover unto you to be evil and an enemy to your ſouls, caſt it off, hide not the enemies of your peace in your own boſoms; for whatſoever you keep back will be as thorns in your ſides, and as pricks in your eyes: Therefore caſt off every weight and burden, that you may run with cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe the Race ſet before you, that through the trials and tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations you may come, and ſo enjoy the promiſed Land; for through many tribulations and fiery trials doth the children of God paſſe; for the children of Iſrael after they were come forth of Egypt, had many Enemies to war withall before they came to the promiſed Land, and many fainted in the way, and through unbelief fell in the Wilderneſſe; which things are written and left upon Record, that thoſe that ſhould come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter might take warning, and not give way to the Tempter, leaſt they fall as they did, and ſo come ſhort of the eternal reſt.</p>
               <p>Therefore every one of you take warning, and take heed leaſt there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the living God: but abide in the meaſure of God which is pure and perfect, though but as a grain of Muſtard-Seed; yet wait, and you will finde the growth of it. When tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als come be content; murmure not, but endure with patience the chaſtning of the Lord, for every child whom he loves he rebukes and chaſtens; for he that is not corrected and chaſtiſed of the Lord, is a Baſtard and no Son.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:116523:15"/>And now is the time come, that Judgement is begun at the houſe of God; and if it firſt begin at us, what will become of the wicked and them that obey not the Goſpel of God? Surely wo will be their portion, and condemnation and miſery will be the end of ungodly men; but bleſſed are they that ſuffer tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and perſecution for righteouſneſſe ſake, they ſhall inherit the Kingdom of Glory; he that overcomes and endures to the end ſhall be crowned with Victorie, and ſhall eat of the hidden Manna, and have right unto the Tree of Life, and ſhall have Vnion and Fellowſhip with the Father and the Son, and reign with the Lord God and the Lamb in the holy City for ever and ever.</p>
               <p>Therefore though you now be afflicted, be not caſt down through unbelief, though you now weep and mourn, and be reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and reyiled, yet your ſorrow ſhall be turned into joy; it is but for a little moment of time, until the night and the ſtormy day be over, and then will come a calm; though ſorrow and trouble may endure for a night, yet joy will come in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when the Day-ſtar doth ariſe, and the glorious day of the Lord doth dawn in your hearts, then ſhall darkneſſe be expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and ſorrow and ſighing flie away, and the preſence of the Lord in the Light ſhall be ſeen, in whoſe preſence there is glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and great joy; and you all his faithful ones, who have paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through many tribulations, and have not loved your lives unto death, ſhall worſhip him in his holy Temple; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall be no need of light, of Sun, Moon or Candle; but the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Lord ſhall fill the Temple, and ſhall be a Light conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually for all his dear children to walk in.</p>
               <p>So all my dearlie beloved ones, who are in the time of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and trial, with you I do partake, and bear part of your bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, as being a Member of the ſame body; and if one Member ſuffer, all the Members ſuffers with it; and though you come to ſuch a condition, trouble within and trouble without, on eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſide Enemies, yet do not diſtruſt God, neither look back in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world of darkneſſe again, there is no help for you there; but as the Children of Iſrael in former time were incompaſſed about, <hi>Pharoah</hi> behinde and the Red Sea before, and on either ſide Mountains, they were even ready to faint and murmure;
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:116523:16"/>but <hi>Moſes</hi> the Servant of the Lord, who was choſen to be their Leader out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> he exhorted them to ſtand ſtill and ſee the ſalvation of God: they were not to ſtand ſtill in <hi>Egypt;</hi> but being come forth of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the Lord ſhewed his wonderful hand in preſervin g of them. So I ſay unto you dear friends, who are come forth of the Egyptian darkneſſe, and are deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from thoſe groſſe evils that the world lives in, and have a light born up in your underſtandings to lead you, but yet do finde many enemies warring againſt you, even they of your own houſe; ſo that you know not what to do nor which way to go to finde peace. I ſay unto you, will nothing, neither do you run before your guide, but ſtand ſtill in the Light that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers your Enemies, and there wait in the will of God, and you will ſee ſalvation from the Lord by his living Power, bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and chaining, and ſubduing the ſtrong Enemies which wars againſt your ſouls; and ſo a ſecret hope will be begotten in you (by the powerful Word of the Lord, which is night in your hearts) which doth purifie your hearts; and that which former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie you committed, impoſlible, by Faith, in the Light which comes from the Son of God, you ſee to be poſſible; and the Lords perfect work being begun in you, you have a ſtrong hope, and knows aſſuredlie, that he who hath begun a good work in you, he will perfect it to his own glorie: And he that hath this hope, purifies himſelf even as Chriſt is pure.</p>
               <p>And here is the patience and the Faith of Saints, which though never ſo little, if it be but as a grain of Muſtard Seed, it removes the ſtrong and high Mountains of Sin, and gives victorie over the the world and the luſts of it, and ſo purifies the heart.</p>
               <p>And this is the true and the living Faith, which the Saints of God were in, who were of one heart and one ſoul; and it is the ſame now as it was then; and all who are in this Faith, by it their hearts are purified, and ſo are led into purity and one-neſs of minde and heart, to ſerve and worſhip one living and true God, in one living and pure way, which is in ſpirit and in truth, where there is no rent nor diviſion, but pure love and union, written in one anothers hearts with the Spirit of the living God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:116523:16"/>So in the light which from the Lord Jeſus Chriſt doth come, who is the true Light which lighteth every one that cometh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world; which Light is but one in all, though thouſand times ten thouſands, this Light is pure and but one; and all who love it and believe in it, are led into oneneſſe and Unity of Spirit,</p>
               <p>In it every one wait and walk, that you may he led out of death and darkneſſe, and all the untoward wayes of the world, into the pure way of Righteouſneſſe and Peace to follow Chriſt in the narrow Path, which whoſoever follows ſhall not walk in darkneſſe, but ſhall have the Light of Life.

Caſt away all filthineſſe from amongſt you, and let no prejudice lodge nor reſt within any of you, but forgive one another as God in Chriſt hath forgiven you; for if you do not forgive men their treſpaſſes, no more will your heavenly Father forgive your treſpaſſes; therefore whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do unto you, do you likewiſe unto them, for this is the Doctrine of Chriſt, and it is not the ſayer, but he that both his Will ſhall know his Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine.</p>
               <p>So the Lord in pure Wiſdom keep you and preſerve you out of all ſtrife and contention, that a daylie growth there may be amongſt you, that you all may be eſtabliſhed in the living truth, no more to be toſſed to and fro with mens Doctrines which be changeable, but all wait upon God in the Light which never changes, that you may be all taught of God, and every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular may feed upon your own food, and have ſufficient bread

               <p>And all my beloved Friends keep your habitations, and ſtand upon your Watch, that you may hear the voice of your belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved when he calls, and be obedient to his voice and do his will; and after you have done his will take heed of exaltation, but wait in patience that you may receive the Promiſe; for the ſame that is unwilling to obey the will of God when the will of God is obeyed, will get up into preſumption; and that which doth preſume in the time of trial will deſpair.</p>
               <p>Therefore every one be watchful, and keep the door of the houſe of the Lord, that the Enemie enter not to defile and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute his holie Temple.

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:116523:18"/>them by their Fruits: if the Tree be evil the Fruit cannot be good: and here by the Scriptures you may try them; proud man or a covetous man are no Miniſters of Chriſt, I know them by their Fruity: The Devil is the King of Pride, and covetouſneſſe is Idolatrr: and theſe two ſins are much reigning among the Clergy-men (the black Coats) though they may get the Scriptures (the good words) which is the Sheeps clothing, for Jeſus Chriſt is compared to a Shepherd, and the Saints and followers of him were compared to Sheep which were innocent and harmleſſe creatures.) Now I ſay that a proud man or an envious man or a covetous man, or ſuch like, they may get the Scriptures (the Declaration) and be full of them, and painted over with the good words and ſo with good words, and fair ſpeeches, through covetouſneſſe makes mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe of their ſouls; this is but ſtill the Sheeps clothing, a fair outſide, but ſee what is within; pleaſe them and they willl ſpeak peace; but croſſe them in any thing, they are full of envie and rage &amp; perſecution; ſo here by their fruits they are known. A proud man, or a Drunkard, or a man that is a ſtriker and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Wines, or an envious man, theſe and ſuch like are marks of the falſe Prophets, though they may ſpeak the good words, yet not being ſpoken from the pure life they do not profit the people, but are deceivers, having a form of Godlineſſe, but wants the power, and ſo leads poor people captive, laden with ſin, and led away with divers luſts, ever learning, but never able to come to the knowledge of the truth: For (do but conſider) can a proud man lead out of pride? Can a proud Prieſt with his Rings and his Ribans, and gaudie attire, can he lead out of Pride? he may ſpeak againſt Pride, but ſpeaking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Pride and living in it, he is an hypocrite, and his preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is in vain. Or can a covetous man lead out of covetouſneſſe? or an envious man out of envie? or a drunken Prieſt can he lead from drunkenneſſe? or any other what ever they be that ſpeak againſt any ſin, and they themſelves, be guilty of thoſe ſins? they do but condemn themſelves, and all their Religion is vain, and their Faith is vain, for if they had ſtood in the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of the Lord, they ſhould have turned many from the evil of their ways,: but they run, and the Lord never ſent them, and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:116523:19"/>therefore they ſhall not profit the people at all. But it may be ſome may ſay, Though they may be proud men, and covetous men (and ſuch like) yet they are good men in the Pulpit, and ſpeaks many good truths; and we are to do as they ſay, and not as they do: And this they ſpeak, becauſe Chriſt ſpoke ſuch words concerning the Scribes and Phariſees, where he ſaith, Do as they ſay, but not as they do, for they ſay and do not. But here you muſt conſider, that the Scribes and Phariſees had the commands of God, and the Law of God, which were to be obſerved and kept, for Chriſt came not to break the Law, but to fulfil the Law; but this was a time before Chriſt was ſacrificed up; but when he was ſacrificed up, and riſen, thoſe who prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched Chriſt did not go to hear the Scribes and Phariſes, neither were they to do as they ſaid; but they declared againſt thoſe things which the Phariſees upheld, which were but ſhadows, &amp; preached Chriſt the ſubſtance, as the Scripture witneſſeth: And <hi>Paul</hi> an Apoſtle of Jeſus Chriſt, in his Epiſtle 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. chap. marks out the falſe Prophets ſo plain, that even he that runs may read; and he doth not exhort the people to follow or hear ſuch, but turn from ſuch as had the form but not the power.</p>
               <p>And ſo all people I do exhort you, as you tender the glory of God and the good of your own ſouls, to turn from all the Prieſts and the falſe Prophets of what ſort, ſoever who have not the power of God, who ſay and do not, for they can never profit you at all; for it is not every one that faith Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the Kingdom of heaven, but he that doth the will of my Father which is in Heaven.
